## Physics knowledge

## Mathematical knowledge
In parallel to this course you will also cover mathematical content in PHY129 "Introductory Mathematics for Physicists and Astronomers". However there are some core mathematical tools that I'll expect you to be familiar with at the very outset of this course.

### Functions

### Differentiation
#### Definition
You'll cover lots of different methods and tricks for differentiating functions during your studies but just as a reminder
\begin{align}
f(x) &= x^n \\ \therefore \frac{\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}x} &= nx^{n-1}
\end{align}

Some common derivatives that may be used in this course are included below for quick reference.

#### Notation
In addition to the standard notation when differenting the function $y(x)$ with respect to $x$ there is another notation style that will be used in this course and indeed throughout your degree, often known as the "prime" notation because we use the symbol $'$ otherwise known as prime.

So the expression $f'(x)$ is read as "$f$ prime of $x$" and is the first derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. Similarly $f''(x)$ is "$f$ double prime of $x$" and means the second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.

It's worth noting a typical shorthand convention in physics when using terms such as "$x$" for position, "$v$" for velocity, etc. When using the prime notation here we typically mean the derivative **with respect to time**. In other words
$$x' = \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=v$$
and
$$v' = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} = a = x''$$
